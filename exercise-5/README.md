# Exercise 5

**Update this README with your answers to the questions below.**

## Comparing File Changes

- What's an easy way to identify the changes in source code from one exercise
  to another?
  - We can use the git command for ex if we want to check changes in 2 different branches tcp server exercise_4 and exercise_5 source code : git diff exercise_4 exercise_5 -- src/tcp_echo_server.cc

## Using Classes

- Here is one way to separate out the code into multiple files
- Is this the best way to do it? 
  - I don't this might be the best way to 
- What are the advantages and disadvantages?

## Introduction to Namespace

- There are different ways namespace is being used in this exercise
- Which way is better? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

## Abstracting Code into Classes

- Abstract the client and server logic into a `Client` and `Server` class
- **Note**: You don't have to use the code in this exercise as a starting point
- You can use the code you wrote from previous exercises instead
- How should you divide the code into files?
- What namespace and directory structure should you use? Why?

## Programming Sense of Taste

- How do you judge what makes a particular choice of namespace and directory
  structure? 
- How do you judge what makes a good naming convention or programming style?

## "Senses" in Programming

- Have you ever heard of programmers referring to "code smells"? How can code
  smell?
  - It just mean that there is code plagiarism or some dependency on other codes
- What does it mean to have a sense of taste in programming? How can code
  taste?
  - It just means how well the code can be written in terms of readability,complexity and clean
- Is there an analogue for every sense?
  - Maybe not sure
- What other code senses can you think of?
  - Similar to our 5 senses,maybe sense of sight means how easy we can figure out the functions and bug of code 
- How many senses do humans have?
  - 5 senses
- When would you want to see something before you touch it?
